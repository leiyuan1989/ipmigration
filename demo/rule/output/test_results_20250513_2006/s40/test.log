### Explanation:
- **Category Identification**: I identified the category based on keywords such as "width," "space," "enclosed area," and "minimum."
- **Symbol Extraction**: The symbol was determined from phrases like "minimum" (>=), "maximum" (<=), or direct symbols (>).
- **Value Extraction**: Numerical values were extracted directly from the text.
- **Formatting**: The output was formatted according to your requirements.

Let me know if you need further adjustments!

### Explanation:
- **Classification**: Each rule has been classified into categories such as `Width`, `Spacing`, `Extension`, `Enclosure`, `Overlap`, or `Area` based on the context of the rule.
- **Symbol Extraction**: Where applicable, symbols like `>=` have been extracted to indicate minimum requirements.
- **Value Extraction**: Numerical values have been extracted and formatted consistently.

If you need further clarification or additional processing, let me know!
