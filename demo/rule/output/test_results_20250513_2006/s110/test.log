### Explanation:
- **Category Identification**: The comments have been categorized into `Width`, `Spacing`, `Enclosure`, and `Area` based on the context of the design rules.
- **Symbol Extraction**: For rules where a specific relationship (e.g., `>=`, `<=`) is mentioned, the corresponding symbol has been extracted. If no such symbol is present, the field remains empty.
- **Value Extraction**: Numerical values have been extracted from each comment and placed in the `value` column.

### Notes:
1. For rules that mention ranges (e.g., "overlap by DUMBA min. is 20%", "overlap by DUMBA max. is 80%"), separate entries have been created for the minimum and maximum values.
2. For rules that do not specify a numerical value or relationship (e.g., "No certain patterns allowed in specific regions"), the `symbol` and `value` fields remain empty.

### Notes:
1. The rule `V1_2b` has two separate conditions: "greater or equal to 4*4 is 0.25" and "space is <= 0.27um". These are split into two separate entries in the table.
2. The rules `V1_4_5_8` and `V1_6_7_9` each contain two separate conditions (enclosure and extension). These have been split into two separate entries in the table for clarity.
3. The rule `V1_12` does not specify a numerical value, but it is an explicit restriction against overlapping with resistors. This should be noted as prohibited.
