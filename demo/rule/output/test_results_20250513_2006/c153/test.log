### Explanation:
1. **Classification**: Each design rule has been classified into one of the following categories: `Width`, `Spacing`, `Enclosure`, `Extension`, or `Area` based on the context of the comment.
2. **Symbol and Value Extraction**: The symbol (`>=`, `<=`) and numerical value have been extracted from each comment where applicable.
3. **Comment Retention**: The original comments have been retained to preserve additional context that might be important for interpretation.

Let me know if you need further clarification or adjustments!
