Here is the analysis of the provided design rules:

1. **Classification and Value Extraction**:
   - Each rule has been classified into its respective category based on keywords like "width," "space," or "area."
   - Numerical values and comparison symbols have been extracted from each comment.

2. **Output in CSV Format**:

```csv

This table categorizes each design rule, extracts relevant numerical values and comparison symbols, and presents them in a structured CSV format for clarity and ease of use.

### Notes:
1. For rules that specify "greater than or equal to" (`>=`), the value is extracted as the numerical threshold.
2. For rules that specify "less than" (`<`), the value is extracted as the upper limit.
3. For rules that specify an exact value (e.g., `= 0.304um`), the symbol is set to `=` and the value is extracted accordingly.
4. For rules that do not explicitly specify a numerical threshold, such as "undoped active is not allowed," the symbol is set to `=` and the value is noted as "Not Allowed."

### Explanation:
1. **Classification**: Each rule has been classified into one of the following categories: Width, Spacing, Enclosure, Extension, or Area based on the context of the comment.
2. **Symbol Extraction**: The inequality symbol (e.g., `>=`, `<=`) has been extracted from each rule.
3. **Value Extraction**: The numerical value associated with each rule has been extracted and included in the table.

### Notes:
- The units (`um` or `um²`) have not been explicitly included in the "value" column, but they can be inferred from the context of the rule (e.g., area rules will have values in `um²`).
- Some comments contain multiple conditions or constraints. In such cases, only the primary numerical value and symbol have been extracted for simplicity.
