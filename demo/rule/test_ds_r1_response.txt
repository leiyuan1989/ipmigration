<think> Okay, so I need to process these design rules and categorize them. The user provided a bunch of rules starting with GT numbers and letters. I'm supposed to classify them into categories like Width, Spacing, Enclosure, etc., and extract the value with symbols.

Hmm, let me see. First, I'll go through each rule one by one. GT_1a mentions the minimum channel length for different voltages. So the category here is Length, and the value is 0.04. That seems straightforward.

GT_1b is similar, just for 1.8V. Same category, value 0.15.

GT_1g is a bit tricky because it has two values. Both are 0.24, but for NMOS and PMOS. So each part goes into Length.

GT_3 is about space between two polys, so that's Spacing, value 0.1.

GT_3c has more conditions. The space is >=0.15 when one GT's width is >0.12um. So it's a Spacing rule with the condition and value combined.

GT_4 is space between AA and poly, so Spacing, 0.03.

GT_5 is about extension, so Enclosure, 0.06.

GT_6 is another extension, Enclosure, 0.09.

GT_7 involves space between poly ends. It's Spacing with a complicated condition, so include all that in the Description.

GT_8 is similar space but with a > symbol, so Spacing, >0.1, and it's not applicable in SRAM.

GT_10 is min space to GT or GTDUM when length >=0.06, so Spacing, 0.13.

GT_17 is area, 0.012, so Area.

GT_18 poly area, so Area, 0.040.

GT_19 talks about maximum enclosed area, so Area, 50000.

GT_20c and GT_20d are DRC checks with formulas. Not sure the category here. Maybe Restrictions since they're checks.

GT_21 says no bent gates except at 45 or 135, so Restrictions.

GT_22 is about GT enclosure, so Enclosure but with exceptions.

GT_24 is L-shaped GT space, so Spacing, 0.04.

GT_25 is L-shape AA space, Spacing, 0.03.

GT_26 is about gate direction in memory cells, probably Restrictions.

GT_27 is bent GT width, so Width, 0.16.

GT_28 is space between bent GTs, Spacing, 0.16.

Wait, I need to ensure each rule is correctly categorized. For GT_20c and d, they're more about checks and calculations, so maybe Restrictions. Also, for GT_17, the rule repeats, so I need to list each occurrence separately.

I think I've covered all the rules. Now, I'll need to format this into a CSV with the specified headers and delimiter. Make sure the Description field is exactly as given without changes. </think>

Here is the classification of the design rules into categories and the extraction of their values, formatted in CSV as requested.

The CSV file categorizes each design rule into its respective category (Width, Spacing, Enclosure, etc.), extracts the value with the associated symbol (if any), and retains the original rule description in the "Description" field.
