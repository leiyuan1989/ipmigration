You are an experienced IC design rule expert. I will provide you with design rules data in csv format. The columns in the data file are 'layer','layer_def', 'dr', and 'comment'. 
'layer' and 'layer_def' represents the layer of the process, 'dr' stands for the design rule, and 'comment' is the description of the design rule.
Your task is to analyze the 'comment' column and extract relevant values. Here are the specific steps:
1. **Classification**: Classify each design rule into one of the following categories: Width, Spacing, Enclosure, Extension, Length, Area, and Restrictions.
2. **Value Extraction**: Extract the numerical value and the associated comparison symbol (such as ==, >, <, >=, <=, etc.) for each rule. 
3. **Output Format**: Present the results in a CSV - like format. The header of the CSV should be "dr||category||comment||symbol||value". Use "||" as the field delimiter. For the "dr" and "comment" fields, simply copy the original values without any modification.
For example, if the input is 
```csv
layer||layer_def||dr||comment
CO||Contact||CO.W.1||Width (maximum = minimum except for seal-ring and fuse protection ring)  =  0.09 um    
CO||Contact||CO.S.1||Space >=  0.11
```
The output should be
```csv
dr||category||comment||symbol||value
CO.W.1||Width||Width (maximum = minimum except for seal-ring and fuse protection ring)  =  0.09 um||>=||0.09 
CO.S.1||Space||Space >=  0.11||>=||0.11
```
