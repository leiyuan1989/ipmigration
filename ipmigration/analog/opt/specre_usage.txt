                  You can use `+lqs' as an abbreviation of `+lqsleep'.
*   +lqmmtoken    Enables queuing for token license capability. When specified, Spectre registers the token request with the license server and waits for authorization. In addition, Spectre ignores all
                  non-token licenses during the wait time since only token licenses are queued.
    +lsuspend     Enables the license suspend/resume capability. When Spectre receives SIGTSTP, it checks in all the licenses before it gets suspended. The licenses are checked out again when SIGCONT is
                  received. You can use `+lsusp' as an abbreviation of `+lsuspend'.
    +lmode <value> 
                  Checks out the required licenses according to the specified value during the initialization phase. Possible values are '<num>' and 'RF'. '<num>' is a numeric value greater than 1, which
                  specifies the number of token licenses to be checked out together. For example, to run APS with the multi-core option, specify '+lmode 4'. 'RF' checks out the required licenses for the RF
                  functionality. This value is case insensitive. If the simulation requires more licenses than specified using 'lmode', the additional licenses are checked out after the initialization phase. 
*   +lorder <value> 
                  Specifies the license check out order. Values are case insensitive. Possible values are as follows: 
                  'PRODUCT': Spectre attempts to check out the product+options combination licenses only.

                  Specifies the maximum number of messages to display in dynamic linter summary. The default value is 25.
    -ahdllint_warn_id=value 
                  Specifies a message ID and applies the -ahdllint_maxwarn option only to the specified message ID. This option should always be used with the -ahdllint_maxwarn option and should be directly
                  specified after it in the command line, otherwise, the option will be ignored.
    -ahdllint_log <file> 
                  Specifies the file name to which the Verilog-A linter messages need to be written. By default, Verilog-A linter messages are written to the output log file.
    -ahdllibdir path 
                  The -ahdllibdir option redirects the library files generated by AHDL to the specified path. If both -ahdllibddir and -outdir options are specified, the library files generated by AHDL will be
                  stored in the path specified by the -ahdllibdir option and other output files will be stored in the path specified by the -outdir option.
    -ahdlsourceramp 
                  Disables source ramping for Verilog-A models. Source ramping of Verilog-A models is enabled by default because it helps with convergence for most designs. However, in certain corner cases, the
                  default behavior could lead to convergence difficulties, which can be avoided by using this option.
    -ahdlnosourceramp 
                  Disables source ramping for Verilog-A models. Source ramping of Verilog-A models is enabled by default because it helps with convergence for most designs. However, in certain corner cases, the
                  default behavior could lead to convergence difficulties, which can be avoided by using this option.
    -ahdlshipdbdir=<sharing_path> 
                  Specifies the sharing directory for Verilog-A library compilation. Given this option, the simulator would search for reusable library in the <sharing_path>. If library is found, reuse it,
                  otherwise, compile a new library in the local directory.
    -ahdlshipdbmode="read_only" or "create_or_update" 
                  Indicates whether needs create/update the library under <sharing_path> specified by -ahdlshipdbdir. "read_only" means not to create/update, which is the default behavior for -ahdlshipdbdir
                  appearing alone.  "create_or_update" means that if under <sharing_path>, there isn't any library or the library is outdated, copy the newly-built library in local directory to <sharing_path>.

                  'lx', 'vx'.
*   +postlpreset=value 
                  Defines parasitic optimization in Spectre X. If not set, Spectre X enables parasitic optimization if post-layout content is detected. If set, parasitic optimization is enforced. The most
                  accurate parasitic optimization is 'cx', and the highest performing parasitic optimization is 'vx'. Parasitic optimization can be disabled with 'off'. Possible values are 'off', 'cx', 'ax',
                  'mx', 'lx', 'vx'.
*   -preset_override 
                  Spectre X by default ignores solver options defined in the netlist. The option '-preset_override' forces Spectre X to honor solver options defined in the netlist. The option can also be used
                  to honor individual solver options: '-preset_override="reltol,method..."'.
*   +xdp=value    Enables Spectre X distributed, multi-processing simulation. Supports RSH/SSH in manual mode: +xdp=rsh|ssh +hosts="host1:1 host2:3". In farm mode +xdp needs to be set, and the job distribution
                  system controls the host/core usage.
    +hosts "<hostname>:<number_of_processes>" 
                  Defines the machine specifications that will be used for distributed processing. This option must be used when you specify the rsh or ssh values with the +xdp option. The format of the machine
                  specification is the same for both rsh and ssh. Each machine specification, which, can be separated by the space delimiter contains the name of the machine and number of processes to be used
                  on the machine in the following format: "host_name:number_of_processes". For example, +hosts "hostA:4 hostB:4". This setting specifies that four processes will be used on both hostA and hostB
                  for performing the simulation.
    +ppn          The number of processes on each host will be automatically same as the number of NUMA nodes. It is recommended for Distributed HB farm run. It is supported in NC, and LSF farm.
    +ms           Enables MS mode.
    +xps          Enables XPS mode.
    +fxm          Enables FXM mode.
    +xps=s[value] Enables XPS SPICE Accurate mode. The optional value is the speed setting.
    +fxm=s[value] Enables FXM SPICE Accurate mode. The optional value is the speed setting.
    +speed=value  The simulation group speed setting. The lower number means conservative setting.
    +query=value  Queries the recommended number of threads or the licenses that are required to run the simulation on the current machine or on one with similar configuration. Possible values are 'mtinfo',
                  'meminfo', 'all', 'alllic', and 'tokenlic'. 'mtinfo' prints the recommended number of threads, 'meminfo' prints the memory usage estimate, 'all' prints the recommended number of threads, the
                  all possible license combinations for the design used for simulation and the memory usage estimate, 'alllic' prints all possible license combinations for the design used for simulation and
                  'tokenlic' prints the number of MMSIM tokens required. The default value is 'tokenlic'.
    +liclog       Writes the license check-in and check-out information in the log file.
    +disk_check[=value] 
                  Suspend the simulation when available disk storage is less than N bytes. Here, N is the value specified using the optional [=value] of +disk_check or netlist option 'disk_check_thresh'. For
                  example, +disk_check=1e10.
    -clearcache   Clear spectre cache directory "/home/<username>/.cadence/mmsim/". You can use `-cc' as an abbreviation of `-clearcache'.
    -disableCPP   Disable cpp preprocess for situation that spectre implicit call cpp such as -I and -D. However, if explicit specified -E, -disableCPP will not take effect.
    +dcopt        The dcopt option speeds up the DC simulation in Spectre and APS for post-layout circuits that 
          consist of a large number of parasitic resistors and capacitors, which require significant 
          time in DC simulation. It can also be used to solve the non-convergence issues in DC simulations
          of any other circuit

          Note: In some cases, the DC solution obtained using the dcopt command-line option may not be as accurate as the true DC solution.
    +lite         Enables a lightweight simulation session where most or all of the computationally intensive features (device check asserts, info analysis, current probing, power probing, instance
                  preservation, ...) are turned off. By default, ++aps is used as the simulation engine. This can be a very useful tool in isolating the computational time used by simulation engine during a
                  simulation performance debugging.
*   +config <file> 
                  Option enables the user to append all 'Spectre' commands defined in `file' to the netlist. `file' may contain one or more 'Spectre' netlist lines. Multiple +config on the same 'Spectre'
                  command line are supported. They are incrementally processed.
*   =config <file> 
                  Option enables the user to append all Spectre commands defined in `file' to the netlist. All +config statements on the same Spectre command line are ignored.
*   -config       Disables all +config statements on the same Spectre command line. Disables all preceding =config statements on the same Spectre command line.
*   +pre_config <file> 
                  Option enables the user to prepend all Spectre commands defined in `file' to the netlist. `file' may contain one or more Spectre netlist lines. Multiple +pre_config on the same Spectre command
                  line are supported. They are incrementally processed.
    +top <value>  When you specify +top with a subcircuit name, all elements, models, and so on will be exposed to the top level and the subcircuit will not exist anymore. As a result, instantiation from this
                  subcircuit will be illegal. Instances inside the subcircuit will automatically connect to the instance at the top level if they connect to the same node.
    -hpc          Disables the hpc option
    +sparam       Enables s-parameters standalone checking and fitting tool.
    +checking     Checking quality of s-parameters data file such as DC value, data discontinuity, reciprocity, passivity and etc. This option only works with +sparam.
    +fitting[=value] 
                  Select a fitting method to perform s-parameters fitting. Possible value is 'rfm'. This option only works with +sparam.
